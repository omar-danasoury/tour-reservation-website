# Tour Reservation Website
This website was the final project of **ITCS 333: Internet Software Development**; it scored 19/20.  
The website is used by users to:  
1. Create Account  
2. View Available Trips  
3. View Other Users' Feedback
4. Reserve Trips
5. Provide Feedback [attendance is managed by admin].

Note: the functionality of providing attendance by admin was not added. It is done manually by changing the attendance field on the database.
